# Introduce of The Repo
## The main objectives of the project are:

#### With the scale-down of the size of the classical semiconductor transistor and the scale-up of the number of integration processes, the continuation of Moore's law is strongly challenged by technical bottlenecks such as power consumption, quantum tunneling and leakage. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new computing technologies, among which quantum computing is a promising direction. By using the effects of quantum state superposition and quantum entanglement, it can realize superparallel acceleration for some algorithms. However, because of the high threshold for understanding and learning quantum mechanics, the principles of quantum computing have not been understood by non-professionals. Most quantum computing scholars start with the hard stuff of quantum mechanics, even if they are only the architects of the top-level systems and programming languages of quantum computing.

#### Therefore, it is particularly necessary to develop a system that can demonstrate the principles of quantum computing and present it to users in a visual form as a tool for understanding, teaching and popularizing quantum computing. Surprisingly, the quantum computing research group at home and abroad does not have a systematic demonstration platform that is friendly to beginners. Only sporadic, blunt, parroting simple introduction, and even more are a lot of misinformation propaganda; Or it can be a professional quantum computing simulation and simulation system directly. Some quantum computing results can be obtained by adding a quantum U gate, but users may not be able to understand what is actually happening.

#### The goal of this system is to provide a platform for beginners who understand the basic concepts of quantum mechanics to directly experience the principles of quantum computing through a visual interface, and to expand the platform to include more principles of quantum algorithm operation. If the project goes well, the interactive function of quantum computing simulation verification can be added to the system.
